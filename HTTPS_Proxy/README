/*****************************************************************************
* Final Project: HTTPS PROXY
* CS 112
* README
* Authors: Isabel Muste, Marti Zentmaier
******************************************************************************/

This program is an HTTPS proxy that has two modes of operation. It can run in
a Man In The Middle mode where all the traffic coming through the proxy is
decrypted when its received and encrypted when it is sent through. When the
proxy is configured to Tunnel mode, no traffic will be decrypted, so it is
sent as is to the receipient. 

As part of the MITM configuration, the proxy has LLM functionality that can
be used when playing the New York Times Connections game. This game displays
16 words on the screen and asks the user to group the words into groups of
4 where the words in each group are related in some way. This game can be 
quite challenging, so to help the user play this game successfully, the proxy
uses the LLM feature to display hints. There will be one hint for each
category to help the user solve the game.


/*****************************************************************************
 RUNNING THE PROGRAM
*****************************************************************************/
The program includes a "makeFile.sh" file which can be used to compile the 
program into an executable file which can be used to run the proxy.

The device on which the program is run must have the OpenSSL library installed.
Besides the OpenSSL library, no additional libraries are required to run the
program besides the files present in the project directory.

To compile the program with the provided make file, the user must type 
"sh makeFile.sh". This will create an executable called "proxy". 
The proxy by default will be run on the 127.0.0.1 IP address but the port 
must be provided as the second command line argument. Lastly, the third 
command line argument must specify the mode with which to run. This can be
specified by entering "--mode=tunnel" or "--mode=MITM".

There is some error logging that can be useful for the user to know what 
went wrong if the program crashes. It can be useful to redirect this to a file
if this is not something that the user wants to see. This can be done by 
entering 2> error.log on the command line.

Example of full command line arguments:
 -  sh makeFile.sh
 -  ./proxy 8080 --mode-MITM 2> error.log


/*****************************************************************************
 CERTIFICATE REQUIREMENTS
*****************************************************************************/
To be able to interact and use the program on a browser, the certificate
that is used by the program needs to be trusted. This certificate is in 
a sub-directory called "certs". This sub-directory contains a file called 
"ca-cert.pem" which can be added to a browser or device as a trusted 
certificate allowing the program to decrypt any traffic.

Once the certificate is trusted by the device and / or browser, the program
IP and port number should be added in the system settings or browser settings
under the proxy settings. 

Trusting the certificate as well as configuring the system / browser proxy
settings will allow the program to be ran and the browser to be used.


/*****************************************************************************
 PROGRAM INTERACTION
*****************************************************************************/
Once the certificate is trusted, the proxy settings are updated, and the 
proxy is compiled and running, the user can interact with the proxy by
using the browser.

Any browser should work for the basic program functionality, but Firefox is 
the preferred browser as it has clear cache and history control. 

To access any regular websites, no special action is required, so the user can
simply use the browser to lookup / interact with any websites. 

To use the LLM functionality, the user can navigate to the NYT connections 
game: https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections. This website will take a 
couple of seconds to load as the LLM call is made and the page needs to be
loaded with the added functionality. 

After the connections page is loaded once, the user should navigate to the
browser settings and clear the cached content for the New York Times website
to ensure that the browser will trust the proxy the next time this website is
accessed.


/*****************************************************************************
 EXAMPLE PROGRAM USE
*****************************************************************************/

1. Install the OpenSSL library
2. Add the certificate file to the trusted files in the system or browser 
        settings 
3. Add the IP (127.0.0.1) and chosen port (eg. 8080) to the browser proxy
        settings or device network settings
4. Compile the program using the command: "sh makeFile.sh"
5. Run the program using the command: "./proxy 8080 --mode=MITM 2> error.log"
6. Navigate to the browser (Firefox preferred)
7. Example browser interaction: 
        https://www.google.com
        https://www.youtube.com/nationalgeographic
        https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections
8. On the connections game page, there will be a button that says "Show Hint"
        which can be used to display a hint. Then the "Next" and "Previous"
        buttons can be used to navigate through the hints of which there
        are 4.
9. If the user wants to go to the connections game website again, the browser
        cache should be cleared before reloading the page
10. To quit the program, enter "CTRL+C" on the command line
